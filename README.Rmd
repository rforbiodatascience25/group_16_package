The goal of cendog is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of cendog from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rforbiodatascience25/group_16_package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cendog)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

# CENDOG

WE are replicating the Central Dogma of biology.

```{r setup}
library(cendog)
```

## Generate a Random DNA Sequence 

```{r}
N <- 1000
DNA_seq <- gen_seq(N)
DNA_seq
```

## Transcription

```{r}
RNA_seq <- substi_T_U(DNA_seq)
RNA_seq
```

## Split into Codons

```{r}
codons <- split_to_codons(RNA_seq)
codons
```

## Translation

```{r}
aa_seq <- translation(codons)
aa_seq
```

## Visualisation

```{r}
plot_amino_acid_composition(aa_seq)
```
